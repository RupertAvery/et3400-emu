! Introduction

The [url:ET-3400|http://www.oldcomputermuseum.com/heathkit_et3400.html] was a microprocessor trainer kit sold in the 70's and 80's and was designed to be assembled by the end user and was used to teach fundamentals of microprocessors.  

My father, an instrumentation engineer who was interested in electronics, bought the kit and kept it around in his workbench and as a young boy I found the time to play with it and even damage the exposed 6800 CPU by attempting to pry it out and put it back in, much to my father's chagrin.

The kit had the following features:

* [url:Motorola 6800|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6800] 8-bit CPU clocked at 1MHz
* Six 7-segment LED displays used to display address and data information, and as a visual output device (i.e. screen)
* 17 push-button switches used as a Hex keypad
* 8 LEDs for general purpose visual output
* 1 8-position DIP switch for data input
* 1 KB ROM 
* 2 x 256 bytes RAM
* buffered 8-bit data and 16-bit address ports

The ROM contained a program allowing the user to (tediously, i.e. byte-by-byte) enter, run and monitor programs in RAM using the keypad and the screen.

This project simulates the ET-3400 by emulating the 6800 CPU and memory-mapped access to simulated 7-segment displays and keypad for I/O. The ROM program is included.

The emulator core and 7 segment display are written from scratch in 100% C#, I only got the basic idea of how an emulator should run from Marat Fayzullin's page [url:How To Write a Computer Emulator|http://fms.komkon.org/EMUL8/HOWTO.html]. It was originally implemented in Visual Basic 6, ported to C++, then finally C#.

! Usage

You can download the trainer's Manual [url:here|http://archive.org/details/HeathkitManualForTheEt-3400MicroprocessorTrainer]. 

!! Loading S19 format files

The emulator supports S19 format files. Click File > Load and select your S19 OBJ file to load it into memory.  Press D on the keypad to bring up the Do prompt. You will be required to enter a 16-bit hex address in RAM. Usually this will be 0000. The ROM will then execute the program.

The manual contains program listings in assembly/machine code and the ROM listing which can be useful for calling functions such as monitoring the keyboard and displaying text on screen.
