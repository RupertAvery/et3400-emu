The accompanying files contain the program listings printed in the HeathKit ET-3400 User Manual, 
compiled and converted to S19 format by Rick Nungester (wa6ndr) on the ET-3400 Yahoo Group

https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/ET-3400/files/ET-3400%20Emulator%20and%20Files/

There are two versions for each sample file. The *a versions contain the original code, while the *b 
versions are modified to run about 13x faster for emulators that cannot run the programs at the 
"correct" speed.

These files can be loaded into the Sharp6800 through the File > Load RAM menu.

To execute a program load the corresponding file (or if it is already loaded, press RESET), press D to 
start the DO prompt and enter the RAM Start address for the corresponding program.
